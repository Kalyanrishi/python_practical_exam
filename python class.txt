1) Define Python Classes and Objects and explain how to create a
class and how to instantiate a class using an object in Python
Programming.

Ans) In python a class is a blueprint for creating objects. It defines a set of attributes and methods that will characterize any object 
     created from the class. An object is an instance of class its a concrete entity based on a class,and it can repersent a person,place,thing,or concept.
    To create class in python, we use class keyword.
      ex:class car:
            def__init__(self, brand,model):
               self.brand = brand
               self.brand = model
            def display_info(self):
                 print(f"{self.brand}
                 print{self,model}
    To instanitate a class and create an object, we call the class as if it were a function,passing the nessary arguements to its 
     __inin__method.
         ex: 
            my_car = car("Honda", "Starcity")
            print(my_car.brand)
            Honda
            print(my_car.model)
            Starcity
            my_car.display_info()
            Honda Starcity
